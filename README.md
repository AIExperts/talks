# Talks

Ongoing collection of talks about spaCy and other topics.

Slides are implemented in [Jade (aka Pug)](https://www.jade-lang.org) with help of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), and are built or served by [Harp](https://harpjs.com).


## Viewing the slides

To view the slides, simply install Harp, clone this repository and run the server from the new directory. Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:9000`. To go straight to a specific talk, you can also go directly to `http://localhost:9000/talk-name-here`.

```bash
sudo npm install --global harp
git clone https://github.com/explosion/talks
cd talks
harp server
```
